- We created an ECS cluster: TestCluster
- We created a Task definition: TestTask
  - For image, our exposed port is 3000 - TCP - HTTP
  - 0.5 vcpu 2GB task size
  - resource limit
    - CPU: 1 GB
    - Memory hard limit: 3 GB
    - Memory soft limit: 1 GB
    - Note we can add environment variables on the task, this will be useful later for DynamoDB
    - We could also use an environment file hosted on S3. That's cool
    - We can turn on log collection here
  - Next, we go to our cluster to create a service: TestService
    - Compute options: launch type / fargate / latest
    - An alternative was capacity provider strategy
      - Fargate / Base 0 / Weight 1 / platform version latest
    - Application type: Service
      - Family: TestTask
  - Oh I forgot to make a Task, which is different from TaskDefinition lmao
  - Trying AWS CloudMap for Service discovery: react.turnipxenon.com
    - It may enable us to have our service to be discoverable by DNS
  - All this time.... AWS blocked my account that's why none of my CDK attempts were working lol
